# Image-Pre-Processing

Pre-processing in a significant step to enhance the images before any further processing of images. It includes spatial and temporal filtering, where spatial filtering is achieved using anisotropic diffusion, bias correction (mainly in MRI due to non-homogenous magnetic field) and normalization of images of different patients with varying intensity levels.
